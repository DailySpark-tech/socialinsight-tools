      <h2>Tool Accuracy & Limitations</h2>
      <p>

      <p>
        We do not claim that <strong>estimation-based</strong> tools reflect real-time data, internal analytics, or official statistics from any social media platform. Results should be interpreted as approximations or entertainment-based insights unless explicitly stated otherwise.
