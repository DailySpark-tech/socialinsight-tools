    <section>
      <h2>Are the results provided by the tools accurate?</h2>
      <p>
        Some tools provide estimation-based or simulated results for informational or entertainment purposes. Results should not be               considered official or guaranteed.
      </p>

<section>
      <h2>Are these tools safe to use?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. All tools on SocialInsight Tools operate in a privacy-friendly manner and do not request access to your accounts or private information. Tools that provide insights or estimations are clearly labeled as such, and none of our tools perform operations that violate social platform policies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why are some tools estimation-based?</h2>
      <p>
        Some tools provide estimation-based outputs because official platform APIs either do not allow the requested information or               because the tools are intended for general insight rather than official analytics. Estimation-based tools use heuristics,                 publicly accessible patterns, and safe logic to provide helpful results while protecting privacy and complying with platform              restrictions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Can I share the results from these tools?</h2>

      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What if a tool doesn’t work?</h2>
      <p>
        If you encounter a tool that fails to produce a result or behaves unexpectedly, try refreshing the page or reloading the input field. If the problem continues, it may be due to a temporary issue or platform changes. You can reach out via our contact link for support.
      </p>
    </section>
