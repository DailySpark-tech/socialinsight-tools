  <h2>About Our Utility Tools</h2>
  <p>
    Utility tools are designed to help social media users handle everyday content tasks more efficiently. These tools focus on writing assistance, formatting, idea generation, and quick content preparation that creators often need before posting.
  </p>

  <p>
    From bio character counters and caption helpers to username generators and text formatting tools, utilities simplify repetitive work and reduce guesswork. They are especially useful for creators, marketers, and small businesses managing multiple social media accounts.
  </p>

  <p>
    All utility tools on SocialInsight Tools work directly in the browser and do not require login or account access. Generated results and formatted text are not stored or reused, allowing users to experiment freely while maintaining privacy and control over their content.
